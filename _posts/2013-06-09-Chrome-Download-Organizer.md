Chrome Download Organizer

This idea came to me browsing around for a way to control where downloads were stored from chrome. I browsed for a bit a realized that no one had come up with a solid way to do this. So I thought why not try and teach myself how to write chrome extensions?

The issue: Often when downloading, I grab a lot of files from the same site. This becomes an issue when I am trying to find the files I just downloaded in the mess my Downloads folder has become.

The solution: I needed an extension that could place downloads in their folders based off of the url they were downloaded from, or as an added bonus, organize them by file type.
